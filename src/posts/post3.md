This is an example post. The third one. This example shows an alternative syntax for lists in YAML. In this case each list item is on a separate line with a dash in front of it

```
tags:
  - post
  - sea
  - boat
  - blue
 ```

 The other posts use the classic square bracket syntax (this is just normal JavaScript syntax for list, also called an array).

 ```
 tags: [post, sea, boat, blue]
 ```

 It doesn't really matter which one you use. Use the one that makes the most sense to you. That said, if you have a series of short, one word items like we do here, then the classic single-line array format may be easiest. If each item in your YAML list is multiple words or has complexity then it may be easier to see it on separate lines like the syntax used on this page.
